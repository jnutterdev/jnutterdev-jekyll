Hi, I'm John Nutter. I'm a full-stack developer with a background in technical and customer support. I enjoy working with a wide range of web technologies, but the stack I use professionally is PHP, React.js, Vanilla JavaScript, and LESS. For my personal projects I reach for [Astro](https://astro.build).

In my free time, I'm spending time with my wife, son, and daughter. And if I can ever find the time, I enjoy producing music with [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com/), or graphic design with [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/). I also really like sci-fi, Star Wars, comic books, listening to podcasts, and catching up on the latest industry news.
