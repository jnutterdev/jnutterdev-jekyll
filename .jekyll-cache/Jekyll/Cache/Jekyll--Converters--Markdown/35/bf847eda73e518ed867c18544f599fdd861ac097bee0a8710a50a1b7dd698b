I"¥<p>Hi, if you didnâ€™t know already, my name is John Nutter. Iâ€™m a back end web developer and linux sysadmin. I have a passion working with Ruby on Rails, and seeking any opportunity I can to write code using it. In this first post, Iâ€™m going to go over some details on how I created this site, and the tools that I used. Itâ€™s not at all an exhaustive post, but just something I put together to get the ball rolling. 
<!--more--></p>

<p>For starters, the website itself is built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Iâ€™m using version 4.0.0 at the time of this writing, along with Ruby version 2.6.3, and a few other gems. The template Iâ€™m using is a free Jekyll version of the â€œFortyâ€ theme by <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5 UP</a> that I came across. Iâ€™ve made some edits to it, mainly removing sections that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be using. So hopefully, everything make sense.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/">favicon.co</a> to quickly generate a favicon for the site using some of the main colors. For all of the images in the index page, and posts, Iâ€™m using images found on the free site <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a>. The artists are a few scattered throughout, so Iâ€™m working on getting the details to add to the posts and give them credit. Though, the nice thing about this site is itâ€™s totally royalty free.</p>

<p>The siteâ€™s colors is where I struggle the most. I usually upload an image to <a href="https://color.adobe.com/">Adobe Color</a>, and then pick out a color and tinker with it until I get something that I like. Iâ€™ll go through 100 different iterations of those colors and combinations before I can finally get something that I like. The hardest part is finding a color combination that looks good, represents me, and that I wonâ€™t get tired of later on. Darker backgrouns with brighter foreground tend to be the best combination for me.</p>
